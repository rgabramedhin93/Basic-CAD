# Basic-CAD
I am creating a caster in my class
## Base
### Description
My first assignment I had to do was to create a caster base. The Base's dimensions are 200mm x 120mm and 8mm thick. It contains 6 holes which are 10mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along them.

###### Reflection
This was my first part made in Onshape. I was following along with Dr. Shields which made it easy. I learned about
sketching
construction lines
dimensions
extruding both add and remove
linear patterns
