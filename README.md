# Basic CAD
I am creating a caster in my class
## Base
## Description
My first assignment I had to do was to create a caster base. The Base's dimensions are 200mm x 120mm and 8mm thick. It contains 6 holes which are 10mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along them.

## Reflection
This was my first part made in Onshape. I was following along with Dr. Shields which made it easy. I learned about
1. Sketching
2. Construction lines
3. Dimensions
4. extruding
5. linear patterns

I really like Onshape. I find that the keyboard shorcuts are so cool. Looking forward to be creating new things.
# Mount
## Description
The second assignment we had to do was create a mount. It is a 120mm by 120mm rectange centered at the origin. It has 4 symmetric holes in the corners. 10mm in diameter and 20mm from each side. It also has another extruded circle in the middle which is 25mm. You also extrude is 8mm.

2. Dimensions
3. Extruding

I'm starting to get better and knowing what to do with building a part on Onshape
# Fork
## Description
For this part you sketch a circle that is 80mm in diameter. Then you have to extrude it 75mm. After that you would have to put fillets. A 15mm fillet and a 1mm fillet. Then you would do a 4mm fillet which the Tangent Propagation takes care of. You then sketch 2 circles that are 15mm and 20mm concentric on the base circle. After that you apply a 1mm chamfer. Then you just extrude through it all.

## Reflection
This was my 3rd part that I created on Onshape. Again I followed along with Dr. Shields and created a fork part. I learned how to
- Fillet
- Chamfer
- Extrude

This part is one of many parts I still have to create. But also this part was kind of challenging for me. I am getting the hang of Onshape and I really think it is awesome.
# Tire
## Description
For the tire you would have to create dimensions. You would have a dimension from the trapezoid to the vertical construction line and from the trapezoid to the horizontal construction line. You would make them symmetric. You would revolve it and then add 8mm fillets.

## Reflection
The Tire was my 4th part made and I started to follow along with Mr. Helstetters instructions, I worked with it well but when I got stuck I went to Dr. Shields video for a little help. I learned how to
- I learned how to Revolve a sketch
- Learned how to connect dimensions to the vertical and horizontal construction lines

This part was actually kind of easy, and I'm looking forward to building the other parts of the caster
# Wheel
## Description
For the wheel you had to create 3 rectangles on a front plane. You would have to add dimensions, add construction lines, make them symmetrical and make them coincidental. You would have to revolve the sketch using the horizontal axis and also add spokes to the wheel.
## Evidence

## Reflection
The wheel was my 5th part and it was pretty hard, I had to restart 3 times because I just kept messing up. I followed along with Mr. Helmstetter today and like Dr. Shields it came out perfectly. I learned how to
- Put in Spokes
- Make sides coincidental
- Make a circular pattern

Overall it was cool making this part and now there are only a couple left to build.
# Axle and Collar
## Description
For this part you had to made 2 circles in a front plane sketch and put dimensions on them. You would extrude on both sides of the circles to create a tube like shape. On a side of the extrusion you would make another 2 cirles with an extrusion on the axle. You would mirror that so it would be the same on the other side. After that you would create a sketch of the collar and extrude that.

## Reflection
This was my 6th and 7th part of the Caster. I put these 2 parts in the same part studio so when I would click on a part it would highlight it on the actual Axle.
# Bearings
## Description
I had to use the Use option on my wheel and select the 2 circles on the face of the extrusion. Then after I did that I extruded it 5mm.
## Evidence

## Reflection
This was my 8th part that I did. All I had to do was just add a bearing to my wheel on the face of the extrusion. Really easy, didn't take anytime at all.
# Sub Assembly
## Description
For the Sub Assembly you would import your wheel and tire and fasten mate the wheel with the origin. You would then Mate the tire with the wheel. Then you import 2 bearings and the axle and do the revolute mate with the axle into the wheel and then mate the bearings with the axle.

## Reflection
The sub assembly is the pre assembly before the final assembly. In this assembly I put together the wheel, the tire, the axle, and the 2 bearings.
# Final Assembly
## Description
For the final assembly you would put together the parts that you made in the sub assembly and mate them with the base and mount and fork. And you would also add bearings, nuts, screws.
