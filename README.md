# Basic-CAD
I am creating a caster in my class
## Base
### Description
My first assignment I had to do was to create a caster base. The Base's dimensions are 200mm x 120mm and 8mm thick. It contains 6 holes which are 10mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along them.

###### Reflection
This was my first part made in Onshape. I was following along with Dr. Shields which made it easy. I learned about
1. Sketching
2. Construction lines
3. Dimensions
4. extruding
5. linear patterns

I really like Onshape. I find that the keyboard shorcuts are so cool. Looking forward to be creating new things.
# Mount
The second assignment we had to do was create a mount. It is a 120mm by 120mm rectange centered at the origin. It has 4 symmetric holes in the corners. 10mm in diameter and 20mm from each side. It also has another extruded circle in the middle which is 25mm. You also extrude is 8mm.
