# Basic CAD
I am creating a caster in my class
## Base
### Description
My first assignment I had to do was to create a caster base. The Base's dimensions are 200mm x 120mm and 8mm thick. It contains 6 holes which are 10mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along them.

###### Reflection
This was my first part made in Onshape. I was following along with Dr. Shields which made it easy. I learned about
1. Sketching
2. Construction lines
3. Dimensions
4. extruding
5. linear patterns

I really like Onshape. I find that the keyboard shorcuts are so cool. Looking forward to be creating new things.
# Mount
## Description
The second assignment we had to do was create a mount. It is a 120mm by 120mm rectange centered at the origin. It has 4 symmetric holes in the corners. 10mm in diameter and 20mm from each side. It also has another extruded circle in the middle which is 25mm. You also extrude is 8mm.

3. Extruding

I'm starting to get better and knowing what to do with building a part on Onshape
# Fork
## Description
For this part you sketch a circle that is 80mm in diameter. Then you have to extrude it 75mm. After that you would have to put fillets. A 15mm fillet and a 1mm fillet. Then you would do a 4mm fillet which the Tangent Propagation takes care of. You then sketch 2 circles that are 15mm and 20mm concentric on the base circle. After that you apply a 1mm chamfer. Then you just extrude through it all.

## Reflection
This was my 3rd part that I created on Onshape. Again I followed along with Dr. Shields and created a fork part. I learned how to
- Fillet
- Chamfer
- Extrude

This part is one of many parts I still have to create. But also this part was kind of challenging for me. I am getting the hang of Onshape and I really think it is awesome.
# Wheel Tire
## Description
For the tire you would have to create dimensions. You would have a dimension from the trapezoid to the vertical construction line and from the trapezoid to the horizontal construction line. You would make them symmetric. You would revolve it and then add 8mm fillets.
